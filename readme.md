This project has a neighborhood map from Kristiansand, which is the largest city
in the southern part of Norway.

How to use this map:

The markers on the startup map are some of the places that are in my city.
Click one marker or item from the My Places list, and an information window 
will open.

The search field can be used to make a search. The information that is typed in
the search field is used in a search with the Fourquare API.

If there is a match in Foursquare a new list of names and markers will show up.
Click the markers to get information about the name of the marker.
