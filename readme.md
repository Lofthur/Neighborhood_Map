This project has a neighborhood map from Kristiansand, which is the largest city
in the southern part of Norway.

How to use this map:

Click on index.html to open the web application.

The table shown with the text My Places is the location I hardcoded.
In the Filter My Places input field, you can type in what you wish to filter.
The table and markers will change to your filter criteria.
Click on one of the markers to see additional information of the location.
You may also click on the items in the table to get the same information.

In the Search input field you may type in something you wish to search for.
For example pizza. Then the my places and filter text field will hide.
The markers and information in the table will be clickable as the above. But there is
no filter function on these markers.

To get back to my places just search for an empty value.

In the mobile view you have to open the table by pressing the hamburger icon in the top left
corner. Everything else works as above.
